# What is It?

This is a very basic audio player. It's just a toy project I created to try out the [mediator pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator) with a tkinter gui.

# How to use it
Note: This uses a [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) based library which requires it to be installed on your machine for it to work. You must also have python3 installed with tkinter. 

1. Drop a few MP3 files into the directory labeled mp3

2. Create virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`, activate it with (on Mac/Linux) with `source venv/bin/activate` and install dependencies with `pip install`

3. Start the program the root directory with `python3 demo.py`
